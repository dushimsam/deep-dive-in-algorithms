## Description
Getting into data structures and algorithms can be so tough for the first time. You may wonder where you can start.
I have organized basic problems you need to know to get mastery of these approaches.
The toughest techniques i can point out in all of the approaches is **dynammic programming**.
I have tried to look into this approach more further by solving it's common problems from the leetcode
in daily challenges.

#### Technologies
- C++ ( The most preferrable language in the implementation of data structures and algorithms due to it's execution speed).
