                   NODE DISJOINT PATH PROBLEM

Definition: What is the maximum number of paths from source to sink , given that each node should appear at most once in every route.
Same problem but on vertice not edge.

                   APPROACH
1. Divide each node into two , for each original node pointing to the new node.
2. Apply the same algorithm of fulkerson-ford for holding in mind that each edge has a weight of 1.
