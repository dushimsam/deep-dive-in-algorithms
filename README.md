## Description
Getting into data structures and algorithms can be so tough for the first time. You may wonder where you can start.
I have included some basic problems you need to know to get mastery of these approaches.
The toughest technique i can point out in all of the approaches is **dynammic programming**.
I have tried to look into this approach particulary more further by solving the common problems about it sorted out from the leetcode website. 
You may find them in a series of daily challenges .

#### Technologies
- C++ (I preffer  using this language due to the size of it's community in competitive programming and it's exceptional execution speed
compared to other languages like Java and Python ).
