1.  Properties of the unsigned long long int data type:
    i. An unsigned data type stores only positive values.
    ii. It takes a size of 64 bits.
    iii. The minimum value that can be stored in unsigned long long int is zero.
NOTE: In case of overflow or underflow of data type, the value is wrapped around. For example, if 0 is stored in an unsigned long long int data type and 1 is subtracted from it, the value in that variable will become equal to 18, 446, 744, 073, 709, 551, 615. 
Similarly, in the case of overflow, the value will round back to 0.

2. Example 
unsigned long long int value = 3;
 ***/

   return 0;
